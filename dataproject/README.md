# Data analysis project

The project is titled **"The change in population around the world between 1950 and 2021"**.

The goal of our project is to analyse the change in population in the World across time. In the project, we are taking a close look into the similarities and differences in population between continents. Moreover, by deviding the population into 15 different age groups, we are able to analyze the age distribution in different continents. Lastly, the following projects presents the forecast of the population growth based on the data.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following dataset**:

1. population-and-world.csv : https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography?time=earliest..2021&facet=none&pickerSort=asc&hideControls=false&Metric=Population&Sex=Male&Age+group=Total&Projection+Scenario=None&country=Europe+%28UN%29~Asia+%28UN%29~Africa+%28UN%29~Latin+America+and+the+Caribbean+%28UN%29~Oceania+%28UN%29~Northern+America+%28UN%29~OWID_WRL

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:
