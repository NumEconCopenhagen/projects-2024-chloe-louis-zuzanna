Our project is titled **The change in population around the world between 1950 and 2021** and is about EXPLAIN.

**Introduction**

The goal of our project is to analyse the change in population in the World across time. In the project, we are taking a close look into the similarities and differences in population between continents.

Lastly, the following projects presents the forecast of the population growth based on the data.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply the **following datasets**:
