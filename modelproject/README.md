# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **THE NEW KEYNESIAN MODEL** and is about EXPLAIN.

We worked on the New Keynesian Model and tried to implement some shocks to it in order to find a steady state.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
