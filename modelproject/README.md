# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **"THE NEW KEYNESIAN MODEL"**.

We estimated the New Keynesian Model and implemented some shocks to it in order to find a steady state.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
